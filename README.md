# *Heart Stroke Predictor*
## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to identify individuals at risk of heart attack. The model uses a dataset containing various health metrics and lifestyle factors and uses advanced algorithms to analyze patterns and predict the likelihood of a heart attack. By providing early detection and risk assessment.
The dataset used contains the Medical history of over 5000 patients which eventually increases the performance of the model.
This model uses algorithms like Random Forest and K- Nearest Neighbour which show excellent levels of accuracy.
